# Jupyter .NET Notebooks Docker Setup

This project provides a Docker container for running Jupyter Notebooks with .NET Interactive, .Net 9 SDK, Anaconda3 and Python 3.12.

> Both dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files are generated using GitHub Copilot and then edited to fix minor bugs and improvements.

## How to setup dev container

To add a development container configuration for this project, you need to create a `.devcontainer` folder with a `devcontainer.json` file. This file will define the settings for the development container.

Here is the updated `devcontainer.json` file:

```json
{
    "name": "jupyterdotnetnotebooks",
    "dockerComposeFile": "../docker-compose.yml",
    "service": "jupyterlabwithdotnet",
    "workspaceFolder": "/home/user/notebooks",
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
            "extensions": [
                "ms-python.python",
                "ms-toolsai.jupyter"
            ]
        },
        "settings": {
            "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/bash"
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure to create the `.devcontainer` directory in the root of your project and place the `devcontainer.json` file inside it.

This configuration will use the existing `docker-compose.yml` file to set up the development container, and it will use the `jupyterlabwithdotnet` service defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

**How to open remote dev container**
